## Description

Exercise for Epicodus' Intro to Programming and C#/React course to practice adding a local state to a React project. The local state will be used to toggle between components/views.

### Assignment Prompt

Avery's Organics is a mid-sized farm in Northern Oregon that grows organic produce and sells it at farmers markets throughout town. Since Avery's is at a different market almost every day, they've started a website to show customers which market they will be at on a given day.

Avery's also grows different crops in different seasons. They'd like to display what produce is available during which months on their site too.

Using React and all other tools we've covered so far, create a website that depicts this information. The data you'll use is in the Cheat Sheet section of this lesson. Also, take time to construct your entire environment from scratch. It's important to practice these fundamentals before we increase the complexity of our projects later this week!

Try using local state to toggle between different days. Note that we can use conditional rendering for as many conditions as we want - including all seven days of the week!

Once again, make sure to plan your application first and include a component diagram in your README.
